Building a website that scrapes Google Shopping to find and display cheaper products can be very useful for users looking to save money. Here are some key considerations and features you might want to implement in your project:

Key Features
Product Search:
Allow users to input search queries to find products.
Use your existing scraping logic to fetch product data from Google Shopping.
Product Comparison:
Display a list of products with their prices, images, and links to the sellers.
Highlight the cheapest options for each product.
User Accounts:
Implement user authentication using Firebase, allowing users to save their favorite products or searches.
Caching:
Use caching to store search results temporarily, improving performance for repeated queries.
Pagination:
Implement pagination to handle large sets of product results, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of results.
Responsive Design:
Ensure that your website is mobile-friendly and works well on various devices.
User Reviews and Ratings (Optional):
Allow users to leave reviews or ratings for products, enhancing the community aspect of your site.
Alerts for Price Drops (Optional):
Implement a feature that notifies users when the price of a product they are interested in drops.
Technical Considerations
Web Scraping:
Ensure that your scraping logic is robust and can handle changes in the Google Shopping layout.
Be mindful of the legal and ethical implications of web scraping. Make sure to comply with Google's terms of service.
Backend Development:
Use Django to create a RESTful API that your React frontend can communicate with.
Handle product data storage, user authentication, and any other backend logic.
Frontend Development:
Use React to build a dynamic and interactive user interface.
Consider using libraries like Axios or Fetch API to make API calls to your Django backend.
Deployment:
Choose a hosting platform for your Django backend (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) and your React frontend (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
Ensure that your application is secure and optimized for performance.
Example User Flow
User visits the website and enters a product name in the search bar.
The frontend sends a request to the Django backend, which triggers the scraping logic.
The backend scrapes Google Shopping for relevant products and returns the data to the frontend.
The frontend displays the products, allowing users to sort or filter by price, rating, etc.
Users can click on a product to view more details or purchase it from the seller's website.
